# HD_plot
HDplot R script developed by Garrett McKinney, I have simply formatted it in a markdown document and am tracking the version I use. Used to define singleton and doubleton loci in RAD data sets, taking a VCF as input. To use, run algorithm, plot data, apply approprate cutoffs to deviation plot, so as to isolate SNPs in the central cloud.
